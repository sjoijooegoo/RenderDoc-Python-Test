      Not an actual member function - the signature for any ``PreviewWindowCallback`` callbacks.

        AddFakeMarkers()
        
        Add fake marker regions to the list of actions in the capture, based on which

        regions.

          This must be called *immediately* after capture load, calling it at a later time will cause

          The event IDs for fake marker pushes and pops will not be contiguous with the surrounding actions
          and will be set to values above the last real event in the capture. This also means they break the
          typical rules that event IDs always increase. It's recommended that these events are not
          referenced directly in other calls such as SetFrameEvent, and fake markers should be used 
          sparingly at all compared to proper application-provided markers.
