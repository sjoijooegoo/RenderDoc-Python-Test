    """
    The types of several pre-defined and known sections. This allows consumers of the API
    to recognise and understand the contents of the section.
    
    Note that sections above the highest value here may be encountered if they were written in a new
    version of RenderDoc that addes a new section type. They should be considered equal to
    :data:`Unknown` by any processing.

      An unknown section - any custom or non-predefined section will have this type.
    
    .. data:: FrameCapture
    
      This section contains the actual captured frame, in RenderDoc's internal chunked representation.
      The contents can be fetched as structured data with or without replaying the frame.
    
      The name for this section will be "renderdoc/internal/framecapture".
    
    .. data:: ResolveDatabase
    
      This section contains platform-specific data used to resolve callstacks.
    
      The name for this section will be "renderdoc/internal/resolvedb".

      details about how the capture was obtained with repro steps in the original program, or with
      driver and machine info.
    
      The name for this section will be "renderdoc/ui/notes".
    
    .. data:: ResourceRenames
    
      This section contains a JSON document with custom names applied to resources in the UI, over and
      above any friendly names specified in the capture itself.
    
      The name for this section will be "renderdoc/ui/resrenames".
    
    .. data:: AMDRGPProfile
    
      This section contains a .rgp profile from AMD's RGP tool, which can be extracted and loaded.
    
      The name for this section will be "amd/rgp/profile".

    .. data:: EmbeddedLogfile
    
      This section contains the log file at the time of capture, for debugging.
