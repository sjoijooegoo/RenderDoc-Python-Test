    .. data:: Unknown
    
      Unknown or unprocessable format.
    
    .. data:: DXBC
    
      DXBC binary shader, used by D3D11 and D3D12.
    
    .. data:: GLSL
    
      GLSL in string format, used by OpenGL.
    
    .. data:: SPIRV
    
      SPIR-V binary shader, as used by Vulkan. This format is technically not distinct from
      :data:`OpenGLSPIRV` but is considered unique here since it really *should* have been a different
      format, and introducing a separation allows better selection of tools automatically.
    
    .. data:: SPIRVAsm
    
      Canonical SPIR-V assembly form, used (indirectly via :data:`SPIRV`) by Vulkan. See :data:`SPIRV`.

      DXIL binary shader, used by D3D12. Note that although the container is still DXBC format this is

    .. data:: Slang
    
      Slang in string format, used by the slang compiler for compilation to multiple backend formats.
