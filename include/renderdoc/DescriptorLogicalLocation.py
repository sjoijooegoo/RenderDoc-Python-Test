class DescriptorLogicalLocation(): # skipped bases: <class 'SwigPyObject'>
    """
    In many cases there may be a logical location or fixed binding point for a particular
    descriptor which is not conveyed with a simple byte offset into a descriptor store.
    This is particularly true for any descriptor stores that are not equivalent to a buffer of bytes
    but actually have an API structure - for example D3D11 and GL with fixed binding points, or Vulkan
    with descriptor sets.
    
    In some cases on APIs with explicit descriptor storage this may convey information about virtualised
    descriptors that are not explicitly backed with real storage.
    
    This structure describes such a location queried for a given descriptor.
    
    For example on D3D11 this would give the register number of the binding, and on GL it would give the
    unit index. Both cases would be able to query the type and shader stage visibility of descriptors
    that are not accessed or even bound.
    
    On Vulkan this would give the set, binding, and visibility. In most cases this information will be
    available for all descriptors but in some cases the type of descriptor may not be available if it
    is unused and has not been initialised.
    
    On D3D12 this would only give the index into the heap, as no other information is available purely
    by the descriptor itself.
    
    .. note::
    
      This information may not be fully present on all APIs so the returned structures may be empty or
      partially filled out, depending on what information is relevant per API.
