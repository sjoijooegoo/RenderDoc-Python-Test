class ActionFlags(__enum.IntFlag):
    """
    A set of flags describing the properties of a particular action. An action is a call
    such as a draw, a compute dispatch, clears, copies, resolves, etc. Any GPU event which may have
    deliberate visible side-effects to application-visible memory, typically resources such as textures
    and buffers. It also includes markers, which provide a user-generated annotation of events and
    actions.
    
    .. data:: NoFlags
    
      The action has no special properties.
    
    .. data:: Clear
    
      The action is a clear call. See :data:`ClearColor` and :data:`ClearDepthStencil`.
    
    .. data:: Drawcall
    
      The action renders primitives using the graphics pipeline.
    
    .. data:: Dispatch
    
      The action issues a number of compute workgroups.
    
    .. data:: MeshDispatch
    
      The action issues a number of mesh groups for a draw.
    
    .. data:: CmdList
    
      The action calls into a previously recorded child command list.
    
    .. data:: SetMarker
    
      The action inserts a single debugging marker.
    
    .. data:: PushMarker
    
      The action begins a debugging marker region that has children.
    
    .. data:: PopMarker
    
      The action ends a debugging marker region.
    
    .. data:: Present
    
      The action is a presentation call that hands a swapchain image to the presentation engine.
    
    .. data:: MultiAction
    
      The action is a multi-action that contains several specified child actions. Typically a MultiDraw
      or ExecuteIndirect on D3D12.
    
    .. data:: Copy
    
      The action performs a resource copy operation.
    
    .. data:: Resolve
    
      The action performs a resource resolve or blit operation.
    
    .. data:: GenMips
    
      The action performs a resource mip-generation operation.
    
    .. data:: PassBoundary
    
      The action marks the beginning or end of a render pass. See :data:`BeginPass` and
      :data:`EndPass`.
    
    .. data:: DispatchRay
    
      This action issues a number of rays.
    
    .. data:: BuildAccStruct
    
      This action builds or copies to and implicitly fills an acceleration structure.
    
    .. data:: Indexed
    
      The action uses an index buffer.
    
    .. data:: Instanced
    
      The action uses instancing. This does not mean it renders more than one instanced, simply that
      it uses the instancing feature.
    
    .. data:: Auto
    
      The action interacts with stream-out to render all vertices previously written. This is a
      Direct3D 11 specific feature.
    
    .. data:: Indirect
    
      The action uses a buffer on the GPU to source some or all of its parameters in an indirect way.
    
    .. data:: ClearColor
    
      The action clears a color target.
    
    .. data:: ClearDepthStencil
    
      The action clears a depth-stencil target.
    
    .. data:: BeginPass
    
      The action marks the beginning of a render pass.
    
    .. data:: EndPass
    
      The action marks the end of a render pass.
    
    .. data:: CommandBufferBoundary
    
      The action is a virtual marker added to show command buffer boundaries.
